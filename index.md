## Hey üëã. I'm Matt.
I loving working with technology communities to build software and develop practices that invite effective contribution.

### Projects I've Helped Build:
* **[The Geek Whisperers podcast](http://geek-whisperers.com/)** as a co-creator and co-host.
* **[Snap: the open telemetry framework](http://snap-telemetry.io)** designing the branding, documentation and contributing strategies.
* **[WADE: we are developer evangelists](https://evangelistcollective.github.io)** as an admin and by creating the website.
* **[Commitmas: learning GitHub socially](https://github.com/commitmas)** as the founder and continued supporter of it.
* **[The Basho Community](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-basho-community)** as the community leader and maintainer.

### Projects I've Contributed to:

I open PRs as I work through new problem or as a way of saying thank you to a project.. That's lead to contributions to a [Slack API Tutorial](https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial/pull/2), [Go GitHub library](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/323) and [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/commits?author=mbbroberg&since=2016-10-01T07:00:00Z&until=2016-11-01T07:00:00Z)'s documentation, because I ‚ù§Ô∏è them.
