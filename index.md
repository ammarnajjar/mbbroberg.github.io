## Hey üëã. I'm Matt.
I loving working with technology communities to develop products that invite delightful engagement.

### Communities I've Helped Build:

* **[The Sensu Community](https://sensu.io/community)** designing community programs from maintainer practices to events like [Sensu Summit](https://sensu.io/summit).
* **[DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun)** as a maintainer, designing the rebrand, and creating the website.
* **[Snap: the open telemetry framework](https://snap-telemetry.io)** designing the branding, documentation, maintainer and contributor practices.

### Projects I've Contributed to:

I open PRs as I work through new problem or as a way of saying thank you to a project. That's led to documentation contributions to the [Slack API Tutorial](https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial/pull/2), [Go GitHub library](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/323), [Slack Go library](https://github.com/nlopes/slack/pull/170), [Leeroy from Docker](https://github.com/docker/leeroy/pull/40), [The Lita project](https://github.com/litaio/lita.io/pull/11), [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1281), [CHAOSS project](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/3) and even the [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/pull/759) because I ‚ù§Ô∏è them.
