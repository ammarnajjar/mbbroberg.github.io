## Hey üëã. I'm Matt.
I love working with technology communities to develop products and content that invite delightful engagement.

## Job Hunting

I'm also **interested in finding my next role.** [Review my LinkedIn for background](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbbroberg/) and [reach out](mailto:matthewbbroberg+io@gmail.com) if you have a recommendation.

Here are a few things on my mind as I plan for what's next:

* **I'm a leader**, open to IC or management positions. I make a significant impact on organizations with an eye on honest communication, streamlined processes, and by building relationships (internally and externally).
* **I measure business value**, and thrive in organizations that respect measurement of even tough stuff like Community ([including stickers](https://medium.com/@mbbroberg/community-metrics-whats-the-roi-of-stickers-640d93b73cd3) if we need to). I'd like to nurture my data curiosity by learning more advanced statistics and data science practices.
* **I want to focus on maintainers and their experiences**. I would love to build better products for open source maintainers or to be the voice of a company that does.
* **I plan to work remotely**. I respect companies like GitHub, Buffer, and Zapier who put the effort into distributed and remote work. I will be based out of Minneapolis, though hope to manage or be part of a remote team.

### Communities I've Helped Build:

* **[The Sensu Community](https://sensu.io/community)** leading community initiatives from maintainer practices to user summits.
* **[DevRel Collective](https://devrelcollective.fun)** as a maintainer, designing the rebrand, and creating the website.
* **[Snap: the open telemetry framework](https://snap-telemetry.io)** designing the brand, documentation, maintainer and contributor strategy.
* **[The Geek Whisperers podcast](https://geek-whisperers.com/)** as a co-creator and co-host.
* **[Commitmas: learning GitHub socially](https://github.com/commitmas)** to collaborative learn Git and GitHub with the [vBrownBag](https://vbrownbag.com/) community.
* **[The Basho Community](https://github.com/basho-labs/the-basho-community)** as the community leader and maintainer.
* **[The EMC Elect](https://community.emc.com/community/connect/dell_emc_elect)** (EOL 2017) as program lead, designing the business plan, brand, and community engagement.

### Projects I've Contributed to:

I often open small PRs as I work through new problem or as a way of saying thank you to a project. That's led to contributions to the [Slack API Tutorial](https://github.com/slackapi/Slack-Ruby-Onboarding-Tutorial/pull/2), [Go GitHub library](https://github.com/google/go-github/pull/323), [Slack Go library](https://github.com/nlopes/slack/pull/170), [Leeroy from Docker](https://github.com/docker/leeroy/pull/40), [The Lita project](https://github.com/litaio/lita.io/pull/11), [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/1281), [CHAOSS project](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-tutorial/pull/3) and even the [CNCF Landscape](https://github.com/cncf/landscape/pull/759) because I ‚ù§Ô∏è them.
