# How to write a task

Slightly-cheesy-but-thoughtful [post from the creators of Todoist](https://blog.doist.com/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-your-todoist-8413b3e06473) changed my philosophy on how to write a useful task.

# Projects

I nest under three top-level concepts:

* Work
* Side
* Responsibility - some call these 


## Priorities

P1â€”Important and urgent. Do these now.
P2â€”Important but not urgent. Must have a due date. Move to P1 on or before due date.
P3â€”Not important but urgent. Delegate to others, or change priority to P2 or P4.
P4â€”Not important and not urgent. Only do if time permits. No due date.

Borrowed from my friend Christian [over at vNinja](https://vninja.net/workflow/how-i-use-todoist/).

## Writing in Markdown

* **Notes** - if you are starting from scratch, decide between [Bear App](http://www.bear-writer.com/) or the do-it-yourself [Joplin](https://joplin.cozic.net/). The latter is open source and robust and the former is simple, sleek, and inexpensive.
* **Todo List** - [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is Markdown compatible by default (and supports emojis ðŸ’¥), which is why I continue to use it for all my task management.
* **Writing** - if you can, ditch your CMS and Word docs for a git repository. Honestly, it's simple, gives you all the benefits of version control, and keeps you focused on the text more than the styling.

## Converting Non-Markdown to Markdown

* **Rich text** - wrote something in that undesirable rich text format? It's cool, [MarkdownIt](http://markitdown.medusis.com/) gives you the quickest way to convert. It's a little clumsy with links, but gets you 90% closer than you would writing and rewriting `[link](http://link)`.
* **Medium** - exporting from Medium to Markdown with a nifty Chrome extension like [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convert-medium-posts-to-m/aelnflnmpbjgipamcogpdoppjbebnjea). It looks like you can write Medium posts in Markdown as well using [code like this](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/medium-editor-Markdown), even [from the command line](https://github.com/timakin/md2mid), though it's easy enough to [import from anywhere](https://medium.com/p/import).
* **Google Docs** - I've heavily relied on the open source [gdocs2md](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html) app to convert Google Docs to Markdown files (hat tip to [this Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19769460/convert-google-docs-to-jekyll-Markdown) for pointing me here).
* **Evernote** - while this project is getting up their in age, I can confirm that [enml2md](https://github.com/zerobase/enml2md) allows you to extract an Evernote export (.enex) into separate Markdown files.

## References when you get stuck

Markdown takes time to internalize and there's no shame in looking it up (I _still_ look up how to link to an image on a regular basis). My frequently visited sites:
